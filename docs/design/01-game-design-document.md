# Game Vision Document: Barry Sharp's Pro Mover

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 28, 2025

## 1. Elevator Pitch

"Barry Sharp's Pro Mover" is an action RPG for Game Boy Color that invites the player to pursue a career as a furniture mover and learn every secret the city of Philadelphia has to discover. You'll learn to back-carry, pack the truck, defenestrate the parking authority, operate elevators, steal cash -- and of course, party -- then you'll get up in the morning and do it all again! Easy to learn, but hard to master, "Barry Sharp's Pro Mover" not only offers many of the most innovative, addictive, novel gameplay mechanics in GBC history, it also features a huge cast of hilarious, off-beat characters, tons of replayability, and gorgeous pixel-art renditions of every corner of the City of Neighborhoods.

## 2. Core Concept & Theme

"Barry Sharp's Pro Mover" is about adventure, puzzle-solving, and overcoming the myriad challenges that confront the player with every day they jump on the truck. Deeper than that, it's about the personal journey and development of the mover themselves. As the game proceeds, the player will build their mover's skills, learn to specialize in certain fields and tasks, and struggle to work on developing themselves as a person before the inevitable day comes when they'll be fired.

The absolute central theme is personal empowerment, the indelible bonds forged between friends when they work hard together to overcome challenges, and the unique perspective that professionally moving furniture gives you—not only on the place where you live (the inimitable city of Philadelphia) but human nature itself. This isn't a game you "win"—it's a reflection of the frustrations that will inevitably confront anyone who's willing to climb an endless series of mountains in pursuit of going their own way.

## 3. Desired Player Experience

When players pick up the controller, they should be so engrossed by the dynamic environments and so entertained by the humor in the game that they're willing to overcome the learning curve and difficulty of each individual mechanic. Even the inevitable failures of a bad day on the truck shouldn't be discouraging or soul-crushing, just enlightening. It should always be exciting to try again and prove you can do it.

"Barry Sharp's Pro Mover" will ultimately utilize the power of nostalgia to make the player both laugh and cry. This isn't just the player's story; it is the story of a rag-tag band of outsiders who have flourished and persisted in one of the craziest cities in the country despite overwhelming odds, a story about how friendship changes (and saves) lives, a story about the power a person can discover by refusing to surrender to the demands of a cruel, homogenous, ever-changing world. You're not nobody—you're a Mover.

## 4. Target Audience

"Barry Sharp's Pro Mover" aims to appeal not only to existing fans of 8-bit RPGs and humorous, quirky indie games, nor will it only appeal to Philly folks. Its reach extends to casual game players who will find themselves drawn in by the narrative, humor, and mechanics. The authenticity of the characters, environments, and experiences will transcend the traditional retro gaming experience. It's for everyone who's ever felt like an outcast and wants a game they can recommend to a friend.

* **Time Pressure & Stakes:** Initial challenges set the tone; choices have consequences.
* **Sandbox Elements:** Days off allow for exploration, personal tasks, or "acting wild," influencing development.
* **Job-Based Progression:** Core gameplay loop involves completing moving jobs.

* **New Game Plus (NG+):** Getting fired (based on hidden variables) triggers NG+, starting the player over with slightly buffed stats, reflecting personal growth and change rather than just item retention.

## 8. Lasting Impression & Goals

It aims to make a lasting impact, encouraging players to think about its messages of empowerment, friendship, and navigating a complex world long after they've put the controller down.
